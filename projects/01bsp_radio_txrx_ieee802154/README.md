# Radio TX-RX Board Support Package Usage Example

Loading this app onto two nRF boards enables communication using IEEE 802.15.4.
Each board sends 125B packets every DELAY_MS milliseconds.

You can test this code by loading the firmware onto two nRF DKs, with one DK in Debug mode to print the received packets.
