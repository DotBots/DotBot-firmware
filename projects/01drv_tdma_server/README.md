# TDMA Server Example Application

To be flashed onto a nRF52- or nRF53- development Kit.

It initializes a TDMA server and assigns slots to every TDMA client that operates in the same frequency.
When used in debug mode, it prints to the terminal the ID of every client registered, the duration of the TDMA frame, the number of clients and the ID of the server.
