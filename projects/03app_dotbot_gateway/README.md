# DotBot gateway application

This application can be used as a gateway for communication between a computer
and a DotBot.

Plug an nRF52840DK on your computer and flash this application on it.

You can then use [the gateway client script](../../scripts/gateway_client.py) to
communicate with the firmware from your computer.
See [the script documentation](../../scripts) for details.
