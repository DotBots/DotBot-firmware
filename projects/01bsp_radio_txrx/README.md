# Radio TX-RX board support package usage example



Loading this app onto the DotBot board will make the DotBot remote controllable by a nRF52840-DK with the [gateway-firmware](https://github.com/DotBots/DotBot-firmware/tree/03app_dotbot_gateway) firmware.

Pressing any of the buttons in the DK will toggle ON and OFF the P0.31 pin on the DotBot's expansion header (P0.31).
