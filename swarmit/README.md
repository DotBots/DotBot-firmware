# SwarmIT samples

[SwarmIT](https://github.com/dotbots/swarmit) provides a lightweight
infrastructure to turn a swarm of robots in a testbed.

3 sample applications, compatible with SwarmIT, are provided to show how to
adapt DotBot-firmware code.
The sample applications are only compatible with the DotBot-v2 target, the only
robot powered by an nRF53 microcontroller, which is a requirement of SwarmIT.
